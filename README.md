TODO
----
* Currently diffs look pretty terrible. Any input on good colors for inserts and
  deletions is appreciated.
  
* I'm not sure what some of the class names in GitHub's common.css denote, so
  in those cases I took a guess. I marked them with `??` in the .scss source--
  if you know what any of them are for, or can show me an example in the wild,
  I'd appreciate it.
